                    I've decided that I wanted to create a place where I can talk about my thoughts and discuss events happening in my life. So, this is why this blog exists.

                    I am a horrible UI designer, but I do like a simple minimalist style. So you'll see that the website's design is heavily inspired by <a class="tokie" href="https://tokiesan.github.io/" target="_blank">TokieSan</a>
