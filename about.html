                    Alright, I don't wanna write a whole page with different sections so let's do this quickly. I am Hope, a computer science student. I am, unfortunately, Egyptian, and I do still live in Egypt (planning to change this in the future). I don't give a shit about religions or deities. Politics-wise I lean more to the left, but this is a topic for another day. I guess that's it for now.
