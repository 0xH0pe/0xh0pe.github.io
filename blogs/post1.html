      <h1>Welcome to the House of Hope</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on October 14, 2025</p>

      <p>This is my first blog post. I'm writing this right now with a headache that's aboutta make my head explode. The house next-door is still being built so I've been hearing the sound of machinery all day. I was actually supposed to go to college today but I just decided to sleep in and not go (Very stupid decision on my part huh, I have only attended one week, and I'm so gonna regret that later when my grades suffer lol). So yeah, Midterms are in 2 weeks woohoo. God, I need to study lol.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll just be posting here about my thoughts whenever I feel like it. I forced myself to actually finish this and I am pretty happy with it I guess. Didn't want it to take so much time so yeah. 
House of Hope is obviously a reference to BG3 if you'd played the game. I go by the alias Hope, so I thought it'd be pretty funny to just name this blog that.</p>
<p>God my head is just, fuck this. I need to go study I've procrastinated enough.</p>
