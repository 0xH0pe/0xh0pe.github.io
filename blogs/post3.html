      <h1>Why I will never have children</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on October 23, 2025</p>

      <p>For some reason I never understood, everyone in Egypt is expected to follow a specific template, as if you stray off of it, the world wouldn't be the same. You finish school, and a few years later, you go meet the parents of a girl, and you get married. Knowing her beforehand is optional btw. The important thing is to get married. Why? Because that's what everyone does. Now, you got married. Great. Now you MUST absolutely have children. Everyone will pressure you, "When are we gonna see your children?" or "You're not gonna make us happy soon?" are all common things that are said in these situations.</p>
<p>Now, the thing is. WHY? WHY THE FUCK?</p>
<p>I have a pretty extended family, so I have witnessed every one of my cousins get married and then have a child one year after that, without even thinking about it, without conciously taking that decision. Pregnancy happens, and they just roll with it. Some of them are not even fit to be married and carry responsibility, let alone be parents and have a life for fuck's sake lmao.</p>
<p>I will never understand it. Whenever I tell anyone I don't wanna have children, they just give me that weird look as if I had killed somebody or said the weirdest shit they've ever heard. It's like straying off the template they're programmed to follow is just uncomprehinsible to them. The funny thing is I am not even anti-natalist, or against having children because it's philosophically immoral or anything. It is a selfish decision yes, but people take selfish decisions all the time anyway. I just don't want children because I don't think I want to lead that kind of life. I have already dealt with enough children for one life-time, practically helped raise all of my younger siblings. So I just want to live life and explore with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>It's so funny because the stupidest arguments I've heard in discussions about this varied from "Everyone has children" to "You won't find any girl who shares your same views." Well, guess what? The first point doesn't fucking matter, and yes, I did find a girl who's amazing, and shares my same views, so fuck off lol.</p>
<p>Respectfully, think about what you're getting yourself into, having a child is a huge responsibility and you can't undo that. So fucking think you pathetic idiots.</p>
