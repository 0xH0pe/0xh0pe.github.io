      <h1>Egyptian Public Transport</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on October 19, 2025</p>

      <p>As an average Egyptian coming from a middle class family, I don't really have the luxury of having my own car. So, like any other 20-year-old my age who has to go to college and work. I take public transport, also known as fucking hell. Why you might ask? Let me tell you my journey from home to college, and from home to work. </p>
<p>On some unfortunate days, I do actually have to go to college. After hours of debate of whether really skipping a quiz is all that important, I end up having to find a way to get out to the main road, where microbuses actually are. Because, yes, my family picked a great place to live, in the middle of fucking nowhere, and besides the occasional tok-tok that passes around 8-9 am, the rest of the day this place is as empty as a fucking desert. So the first problem is to find out a way to go out, my dad drives me sometimes if he's there to the موقف, other times, I have to find an alternative or when all hope is lost, I take an uber (which takes like, 100 L.E on average, fucking crazy man.)Then I take a microbus. Now the microbus environment really depends on luck, I have spent a lot of time figuring out the perfect place to sit, but even that isn't perfect as there are a lot of factors. You never sit behind the driver, why? you might ask, Cigarette Smoke. If you asthma like me, it means coughing and trouble to breathe for the rest of the day. Plus, you now have the responsibility of لم الأجرة so good fucking luck with that lmao. </p>
<p>Now, besides people's bodies packed next to one another like it's a damn canned sardine, people are fucking stupid and have no fucking clue what's societally okay, and what's not (ironic coming from the autistic guy lol). But yeah, in the past two days, I have sat next to a guy listening to Umm Kulthoum on speaker, and next to one girl watching TikToks of Mahraganat songs, again, on speaker. My poor ears fucking suffer with every journey. Now if all of that is okay to you, getting stuck in traffic fucking sucks, not because of the traffic itself - which does suck btw - but because of all the noise pollution that exists when more than two Egyptian drivers are in the same place at once. It's all just BEEP BEEP BEEP, IT FUCKING DRIVES ME CRAZY.</p>
<p>But that's fine, I can take that I guess. Then comes the time to take the metro. The metro is honestly not the worst part. Unless it's crowded, and you are stuck between people unable to move freely, with the air smelling like sweat, and especially when there's فلاحين on the metro. Cuz yes, they don't know how the fuck to be civilized, and they move around and talk loudly like they fucking own the place disrupting everyone else. But when there is no one? The metro is a blessing.</p>
<p>Then, after all of that, I have to walk to college. Through one of the most crowded, hell-like places on Earth. If hell exists on earth, it's this place. Every breath of air is like snorting black smoke that destroys your lungs at a rate of millions of cells per second.
It's crazy how much air pollution exists in that place, and that's without mentioning the amount of noise that drives me crazy man, it gets overwhelming really fast, and I just have to speed through there to reach college.</p>
<p>Do you get why I fucking hate Egyptian transportation now?</p>
