      <h1>Why I hate this world</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on October 30, 2025</p>

      <p>Sometimes I wonder if life is really worth living. The instinct of survival, hope, and the fact that I won't get a second chance, are the only things keeping me going at this point. Why is life not worth living? I mean, why the fuck would it even be? </p>
<p>It might be that I hate living in Egypt, I don't know. But yeah, I do hate Egypt. I hate the ignorant, backwards, animals who are incapable of basic thinking, let alone critical thinking. I hate that I have to live among a population whose majority is like that. People who act religious, to appease others around, yet do everything they criticise and stand against in secret.</p>
<p>This society is so full of shit and hypocrisy. They have no problem watching a man kill a woman in the street, after beating and torturing her up. Yet, they will attack, and play morality police when it comes to a couple kissing in the street. Talking about how INApPRoPiAtE that is, and how it shouldn't happen.</p>
<p>The other day, I was reading a post on reddit. A guy hugged his girlfriend on a college campus. Only to be ambushed by a group of sarsageya who literally proceeded to beat him, then when she tried pushing them off of him they harassed her. All of that, while people watched. It really makes me wonder, how can these people live with themselves. When someone has no actual life, besides trying to present themselves as a sarsagy like that. I tried to look for the post again, to know what happened to this guy and that girl. I really hope they're doing better after going through such a traumatic experience.</p>
<p>This is just one part of the story. Aside from hypocrisy, there's also injustice. Injustice everywhere. Stupid corrupt idiots ruling over the masses trying to impose their failed stupid visions for what everyone should be like.</p>
<p>I feel like I am going to explode. I walk in the street every single day, afraid that it might be the last. When I have a female friend walking with me, I am afraid I won't be able to protect her. I am afraid of what might happen to my family members, my friends, or me. I live among zombies with no morals, no goals, and no life. They don't think. They're selfish and ignorant.</p>
<p>I have hope, that one day I will leave this country and leave all of that behind me. But sometimes I wonder, why was I even born here in the first place? I didn't choose to be born into this world. A world where billionaires who can solve world hunger choose to do nothing, but exploit more people to gain more wealth.</p>
<p>How can people live like this?</p>
