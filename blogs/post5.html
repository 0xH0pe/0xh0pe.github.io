      <h1>Think - Part 1</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on November 28, 2025</p>

      <p>I have been working on getting back to reading. The pace is very slow to be honest since I only read before going to sleep, or on my days off. So yeah it's been taking quite a long time. In the past five months I have read "The Red Flag: A History of Communism" (Amazing book btw), and I started reading "Think: An Introduction to philosophy." which has been so good.</p>
<p>I wanted something lightweight to get into philosophy, and thanks to reddit I learned about this book. So far, I have only finished the first chapter and about half of the second chapter. The slow pace is also really helping because it gives me time to reflect on what I've read and analyze it well.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, we start with Descartes and his positions on knowledge. Descartes was like any of us, he asked the question "How can I know for sure that everything I experience is real?", and he even went further with his thought-experiment to assume that there exists a being whose sole purpose was to deceive Descartes. He referred to that being as the demon. The demon's purpose was to make sure that it deceives Descartes, that everything he experiences was not true. How could he prove otherwise though? He started by trying to build a base to start from. This is where the infamous "I think, therefore I am." comes into place. He reached the conclusion, that because he was thinking, as in experiencing the act of thinking and analyzing like that, he himself must exist. In other words, it would be a contradiction to say that the demon is deceiving him into believing that he's experiencing this act of thinking, and to say that he doesn't exist. The two can't be true at the same time. Therefore, if he believes that he's thinking, then he MUST exist. Either he's really thinking, or the demon is deceiving him into thinking so, and in both cases he has to exist. At least that's how I understand it.</p>
<p>After establishing that he exists, Descartes goes on to try to prove other things, but he struggles to prove that the things he is experiencing through his senses are, too, 'real'. For all he knows, it could be the demon making them seem so. He, then, resorts to God. He claims that since God is not a deceiver, then what he is experiencing must be real.</p>
<p>Now, dear reader, if you were like "wtf?," so was I. I disagree a lot with this point from Descartes. We started trying to prove that anything at all exists, including this so called God, yet we end up using the thing we are trying to prove to prove that shit exists? If this isn't circular reasoning, then I don't know what is honestly. Descartes makes a huge jump, and for what reason? His desire to believe in a higher power, makes him make this irrational jump.</p>
<p>I don't know how we could prove that anything at all exists. Heck, I am still learning the ABCs of philosophy and logic. But I can't accept this kind of reasoning either. I can't just assume that God exists, and then assume that he is no deceiver, and then assume that he has the power to make things true, and then assume that he even wants to do so. It's so many fucking assumptions.</p>
<p>I know some people like Nietzche, disagree with even Descartes first premise. But I care more about the second one tbh. However, it was a pretty good experience. I am still planning on reading the Meditations. I've downloaded them and I'll read them once I am done with this book. Although he does make some irrational jumps sometimes, it was still pretty insightful to read and made me think and criticize a lot of things I took for granted.</p>
<p>I plan on making a second part, when something catches my attention that I want to talk about.</p>
